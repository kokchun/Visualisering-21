# Visualisering, presentation & storytelling (AI-21)

This is a course with focus of learning concepts in visualising data and presenting it. Visualisation is crucial both for the data scientist to explore and make sense of the data to be able to answer important questions about the data. Also it is crucial for other team members, maangers and customers to easily understand the data and its characteristics. Hence this course will build upon prior knowledge in data processing using **pandas**.

All lecture codes and exercises can be found in the course [Github repo][ghr].

## Resources

Many exercises and lecture materials are in form of Jupyter notebooks with **.ipynb** extensions. Sometimes GitHub may not load them correctly for preview, then you can use [Open in Colab][colab_addon], which is an addon in Chrome to open the notebook in Colab. Alternatively, you can go to [jupyter nbviewer][nbviewer], and paste the link to the notebook for previewing. When working with exercises it is important that you create your own notebooks (.ipynb) or script files (.py).
